# Google Drive Grive script that syncs your Google Drive folder on change
# This functionality is currently missing in Grive and there are still no
# official Google Drive app for Linux coming from Google.
#
# This script will only detect local changes and trigger a sync. Remote
# changes will go undetected and are probably still best sync on a periodic
# basis via cron.
#
# Kudos to Nestal Wan for writing the excellent Grive software
# Also thanks to Google for lending some free disk space to me
